# GS RACE AI - Unity Racing AI Simulation

---

## Overview

**GS RACE AI** is a sophisticated Unity-based racing AI simulation project designed for autonomous vehicle behavior in racing scenarios. The project demonstrates professional-grade AI systems, advanced vehicle physics, and multi-agent racing capabilities.

This platform is ideal for research, game development, and AI-driven simulation for racing games.

## Features

### Vehicle Physics
- Realistic wheel colliders and suspension
- Configurable drive types: FWD, RWD, AWD
- 5-speed gear system with torque distribution
- Differential system for stability and torque vectoring
- Pacejka tire model for professional tire simulation
- Speed-adaptive steering sensitivity
- Advanced telemetry integration via `SpeedMeterUI`

### AI Systems
- Pathfinding using Unity NavMesh
- Rule-based decision making: braking, overtaking, reversing
- Multi-sensor obstacle detection (8 directions)
- Real-time opponent analysis and tactical behavior
- Drafting and cornering optimization
- Multi-agent team coordination
- Weather adaptation: Rain, Fog, Snow

### Game & Scene Management
- Dynamic AI and player vehicle spawning
- Race position tracking and lap counting
- Smooth camera transitions
- Simulation speed controls and pause/reset functionality
- Multi-car race scenarios (2-4 AI cars)
- Player vs AI integration
- Complex urban and track environments

### Editor & Debugging Tools
- Waypoints editor for custom track setup
- Gizmos for pathfinding and sensor debugging
- Dynamic UI system for per-vehicle telemetry
